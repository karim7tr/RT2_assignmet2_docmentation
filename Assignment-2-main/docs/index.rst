\section{Introduction}
The assignment\_2\_2022 repository contains various files and scripts that are integral to a specific assignment or project. This report aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of the repository's contents, highlighting the purpose and functionality of each file.

\section{File Overview}

\subsection{CMakeLists.txt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} CMakeLists.txt is an essential file in a ROS (Robot Operating System) project, as it defines how the project should be built.
    \item \textbf{Functionality:} It specifies the project name, required packages, dependencies, compilation flags, and other build-related configurations.
    \item \textbf{Usage:} CMake uses this file to generate build scripts for different build systems (e.g., Make, Ninja) to compile the project.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{package.xml}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} package.xml is an XML file that provides information about the ROS package.
    \item \textbf{Functionality:} It includes metadata such as the package name, version, maintainer details, license information, and package dependencies.
    \item \textbf{Usage:} This file is crucial for package management, package distribution, and ensuring compatibility between different ROS packages.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{src/ directory}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} The src/ directory contains the main source code files for the project.
    \item \textbf{Functionality:} These scripts implement the project's functionalities, algorithms, data processing, and communication with external devices or services.
    \item \textbf{Usage:} The scripts within this directory are responsible for the core operations of the project and may interact with other ROS nodes and modules.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{launch/ directory}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} The launch/ directory stores ROS launch files, which define the configurations and parameters for launching ROS nodes.
    \item \textbf{Functionality:} Launch files allow for the simultaneous execution of multiple ROS nodes with specific settings.
    \item \textbf{Usage:} Launch files are used to start and manage the project's ROS nodes, set parameters, and establish connections between nodes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{config/ directory}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} The config/ directory contains configuration files for the project.
    \item \textbf{Functionality:} These files store parameters, settings, or calibration data used by the project's scripts or ROS nodes.
    \item \textbf{Usage:} Configuration files allow for easy customization of the project's behavior without modifying the source code directly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Files}
Additional files such as README.md, LICENSE, or documentation files may also exist in the repository. These files provide instructions, project descriptions, licensing information, or other relevant documentation.

\section{Conclusion}
The assignment\_2\_2022 repository comprises various files and scripts that are vital for the project's functionality. The CMakeLists.txt file defines the project's build configurations, while the package.xml file contains essential metadata and dependency information.

The src/ directory houses the main source code files, implementing the project's core functionalities. The launch/ directory contains launch files for managing and starting ROS nodes, and the config/ directory stores configuration files for customizing the project's behavior.

To gain a deeper understanding of the project, it is crucial to review and analyze the contents of each file, along with any accompanying documentation or instructions provided within the repository.
